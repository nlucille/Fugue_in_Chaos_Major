# Fugue_in_Chaos_Major
A novel generated from Fugue in C Major by Bach and Corpora word lists by Dariusk


I found and abc file, which is a text based version of sheet music, of Fugue in C Major by Bach and replaced each note, accidental, measure and section separator, and note length with a kind of word or phrase to generate a novel with each chapter keeping with the fugue structure but being very different in content. This produces a fairly nonsensical piece of text, but each chapter preserves the original structure of the sheet music.

The novel will be different everytime the code is run.
